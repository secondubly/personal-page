Hello! I'm Tarik and this is my little corner of the internet. I've got a [blog](/blog), [projects](/projects), and eventually a bunch of other things. I am a second-generation Caribbean software engineer with experience in both frontend, backend, and fullstack work. I've got an unhealthy obsession with videogames, anime/manga, mystery novels, learning languages (currently working on both Japanese *and* Spanish), and sometimes writing.

This website contains (and never will contain) no AI, ads, tracking, no affiliate links or sponsorship of any kind, this place is where I come to unload and unwind and to be unapologetically myself.
